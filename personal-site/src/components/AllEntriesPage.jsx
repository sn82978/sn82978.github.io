I also applied UMAP for unsupervised analysis to explore relationships between SNP frequency changes and evolutionary trajectories, with the project funded by Calit2.",

The model predicts egg counts at the tile level, reconstructs them into cap counts, and then sums across the grid, with this work winning #1 at the UROP 2025 Group Oral Speech Competition and funded by UCI UROP.",

To address this, we evaluated general-purpose and code-specific LLMs on 26 open-source repositories and their forks, finding that they achieved near-human accuracy in identifying clone distribution and performed well at distinguishing clone subtypes.",

The idea is to label each square, the name of the file is modified, and then to train, the dataset is set up such that the class is extracted directly from the file's name.",
