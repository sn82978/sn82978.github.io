# Welcome to my Personal Site!

## Introduction
I started making this site to explore web development. The site started off with pure HTML and some CSS, but I later began developing it over the summer with React. 

## What's it made of?
I made this site using React+Vite, JavaScript XML, and CSS. If you look through it, the primary components at play here are the site's background based on the first Matrix movie (see the source code in ```MatrixBackground.jsx```), the footer and header (```Footer.jsx``` and ```Header.jsx```), and the Nav bar (```Navigation.jsx```). The Matrix background took the most time for me since I had to figure out how to align the numbers correctly and later decided I wanted to make the falling characters variable. 

## Additions
This website is far from done, some things I want to implement in the future are:
- Better organization, right now all my pages are in src and not all the files in the components directory are components. Additionally, I have one massive CSS file that holds all the styling for all the pages on the site, I want to make my CSS file modular similar to what I did in my latest site [Boiling Bad](https://sn82978.github.io/BOILING-BAD/).
- Make a Personal page, something to showcase my personality and interests further than my homepage's blurb.
- Add more silly features, such as a red pill-blue pill easter egg to make the site more interesting.
- Integrate a CV into my website rather than just the clickable resume in the navigation bar.
