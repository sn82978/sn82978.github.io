# Welcome to my Personal Site!

## Introduction
I started making this site to explore web development. The site started off with pure HTML and some CSS, but I later began developing it over the summer with React, exploring different types of components.

## What's it made of?
I made this site using React+Vite, JavaScript XML, and CSS. The site is modeled on Spotify's UI. Why? I am a huge music nerd, and I adore Spotify's UI. Moreover, I thought it would be fun to use the Spotify Artist's page to showcase my work since--if you think about it--computer programmers are arists in their own way :)

### Navigation
"Resume," "Projects," "CV," BORING! What about Discography? Your work throughout your career is your discography! Your projects are albums are your silly off-hand programs are singles! This thought made me decide to reformat my navbar to reflect playlists on Spotify, the way that they showcase arists' work. Also, having weird names in the navbar makes you want to explore more, too :)

## Additions
My friends know that I always start making changes to this site when it's finals and changes I make are always related to the UI. This is the third change to the UI that I have been in the life of this website, so, this site is very much living and is going to have more changes! Here are some things I am planning to implement:
- Modularized CSS files, similar to what I did in Boiling Bad
- Easter eggs! The play button, Create, and three dots can do something, I have not yet decided what they will do, through
- Change "Popular Tracks" to something interesting rather than just something that could be the footer.
- Delete Projects.jsx and Research.jsx? (Not sure if I will do this, these contains a lot of writing that I did)
